# LibraryAPI

I recomend that you build a docker image, and start the thing in a container. Then it should be a easy thingy to work with the solution.

## What is this think anyway?

This is an Easy API for educational purposes.

The API simulates a private library, with opportunities for adding and removing books.
There are some problems though.
1: There is no frontend for the application, something that makes it harder for the users to update the library.
2: What other functionality can we expect from this API?
3: can we use the codebase to write more tests?

## To test the API

run >pytest in CLI.
