# What is this think anyway?

This is an Easy API for educational purposes.

The API simulates a private library, with opportunities for adding and removing books.
There are some problems though.
1: There is no frontend for the application, something that makes it harder for the users to update the library.
2: What other functionality can we expect from this API?
3: can we use the codebase to write more tests?

# To test the API
run >pytest in the console
